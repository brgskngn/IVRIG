# IVRIG
Small Ruby program that quizzes you on Swedish irregular verbs.
Written with Ruby 2.3.1

The Irregular Verbs Really Interesting Game (IVRIG) is a small, simple program with only one purpose in life: to quiz learners of the Swedish language on strong and irregular verbs. It asks you questions & keeps score on how many questions you answered and how many of those you answered correctly.

How to install: Install Ruby.

Download one of the Ivrig files. Double-click it or open it in the terminal. Done.

There are two different versions:
- Ivrig.rb: this is the default version.
- Ivrig-ae.rb: this is the version for umlaut-challenged systems. It replaces ä with ae, ö with oe and å with aa. Use it if your operating system, your keyboard or your Indogermanophobic parents won't let you use umlauts.

Apart from that, the versions are the same.

Some more notes:
- There are about a hundred verbs in here. It's probably not an exhaustive list of all relevant verbs though.
- Where there exist alternate forms of a verb, I chose the more irregular one. So, for example, this program uses “simma - simmar - sam - summit” even though “simma - simmar - simmade - simmat” is also correct.
- Many verbs have more than one meaning. This program uses what I consider the 'main' or most common meaning but depending on the verb it allows up to two alternate translations. For example, the main translation of 'rinna' is 'flow' but 'run' is also accepted.
- There are two different irregular verbs that mean each 'to fall' and 'to pinch'. This is 100% the fault of Sweden, I can't think of a better translation for any of the 4 words, so you'll just have to rage when the program mocks you for guessing wrong :)
